# Elementor Components

<Badge type="tip" vertical="top" text="Elementor Core" /> <Badge type="warning" vertical="top" text="Basic" />

Elementor contains numerous components developers can modify to extend Elementor’s capabilities. This section contains a list of components currently covered by this documentation.

## Available Components

Below is a list of Elementor components, along with a short description and links to more in-depth information:

* [Context Menu](./../context-menu/)

  When editing elements in the preview area, right clicking an element accesses actions that can be applied via a context menu. Custom actions can be added to these context menus.

* [Finder](./../finder/)

  The finder offers easy access to many pages and settings on the site. Developers can extend the finder, adding and removing items and categories.

* [Widgets](./../widgets/)

  Elementor contains dozens of useful widgets in the widgets panel. Developers can create their own widgets, introducing advanced functionality not currently present in Elementor.

* [Controls](./../controls/)

  Elementor Controls are input fields and UI elements used to construct an interface. Developers can customize the available settings and change the design in the editor’s preview area.

* [Dynamic Tags](./../dynamic-tags/)

  Dynamic Tags are used to insert customized data based on various sources. Addon developers can create a wide range of dynamic tags, and even use external APIs to pull data to Elementor.

* [Themes](./../themes/)

  The theme builder transformed Elementor from a page builder to a full site builder. Theme developers can make their themes “Elementor compatible” with theme locations.

## More Components

As Elementor grows, we will be adding documentation for more components. This is part of our fundamental commitment to encourage and support third-party developers. As part of this process, we are doing everything possible to simplify our codebase, making it easier for external developers to implement their ideas within the Elementor infrastructure.
