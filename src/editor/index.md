The editor is the environment in which users create pages and control site settings. Editor is a general term that includes two main areas - the preview and the panel. Each of these areas contains inner areas which can be extended by 3rd party developers.

## Structure

The editor refers to the entire editing screen and consists of two main areas:

* [Elementor Preview](./elementor-preview/)
* [Elementor Panel](./elementor-panel/)

## Editor Panels

The panel can be compared to a sideboard and its functionality will depend on what panel is being displayed:

* [Menu Panel](./menu-panel/)
* [Site Settings Panel](./site-settings-panel/)
* [User Preferences Panel](./user-preferences-panel/)
* [Page Settings Panel](./page-settings-panel/)
* [History Panel](./history-panel/)
* [Widget Panel](./widgets-panel/)
