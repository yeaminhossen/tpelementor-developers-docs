The **menu panel** is the main panel in [the editor](./../editor/). From here, users can navigate to the other panels. In other words, it acts as a dashboard for other Elementor panels.

## Structure and Functionality

The panel has two sections:

* **Settings** - Links to other panels controlling the settings.
* **Navigate From Page** - Links to external links and tools.

## Extending the Menu Panel

Developers can add new links to the menu panel. For consistency, the links should open other Elementor panels.
