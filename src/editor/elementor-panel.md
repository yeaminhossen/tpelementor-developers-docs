The panel is like an editing dashboard. This is the area where users can control all aspects of a page. It includes the global settings, page settings, widgets panel etc.

## Elementor Panels

The panel area consists of several panels:

* [Menu Panel](./menu-panel/)
* [Site Settings Panel](./site-settings-panel/)
* [User Preferences Panel](./user-preferences-panel/)
* [Page Settings Panel](./page-settings-panel/)
* [History Panel](./history-panel/)
* [Widgets Panel](./widgets-panel/)

## Extending the Panels

Some of these panels are extendible. Developers can add new elements to existing panels and we're working on an official way to create new panels, without the workarounds currently used by some addon authors.
