Elementor has many interesting hooks that let developers change default settings and even extend Elementor with new functionality.

## What are Hooks

A hook is a feature that allows developers to manipulate functionality without modifying core files. A hook can help developers inject some functions or edit default settings.

Action hooks are used to run custom code when certain events occur. Filter hooks are used to return modified values for certain parameters, based on different factors.

## Elementor Hooks

Elementor has both **filter hooks** and **action hooks**. It also offers **PHP hooks** and **JS hooks**. These hooks come as both **frontend hooks** and **editor hooks**.
